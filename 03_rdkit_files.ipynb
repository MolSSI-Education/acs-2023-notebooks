    "\n",
    "Data for any system under investigation that is non-ideal, from real systems in experimental methods to optimized geometries in QM methods, cannot be communicated via a smile string.  In these situations, often more detailed specifications are needed, such as an accurate 3D geometry with explicit hydrogens.  Part of the utility of RDKit lies in its ability to create Mol objects using a variety of input formats, so that we can take molecular data from other sources or research processes and generate additional properties and descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different methods are called for depending on the format of the molecule's specifications, depending on what you're passing passing around, between researchers, applications, or modules.  Two common and versatile formats that we'll cover today are the MOL file and related Structural Data File (SDF)."

    "\n",
    "Sanitization in RDKit is a process in which RDKit uses the molecular connectivity graph and element list to predict certain molecular features in a standardized way.  These properties include finding radicals or charged atoms, determining aromaticity, VSEPR hybridization, degree of conjugation, etc.  This process can also be used to find common problems in a hypothetical molecule, such as a hyperconjugated carbon.\n",
    "\n",
    "Working with SMILES strings or MOL files, sanitization can largely be ignored and allowed to process by its default parameters, however there are a few cases in which one may wish to control the sanitization steps more explicitly.  For example, full sanitization of aromatic heterocycles such as the imidazole ring in Histidine(His) or the indole in Tryptophan(Trp) will cause RDKit to miss the aromaticity of these rings.\n",
    "\n",
    "For a list of sanitization flags, see the [rdmolops module](https://www.rdkit.org/docs/source/rdkit.Chem.rdmolops.html) in the RDKit documentation.\n",
    "\n",
    "To set the sanitization, the flags are passed to a variable and concatenated by means of a bitwise OR function, which is then passed along with the molecule to the **sanitize** function as parameters.  The syntax is as follows:\n",
