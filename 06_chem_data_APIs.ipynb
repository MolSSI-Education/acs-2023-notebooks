    "[Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/): The Protein Data Bank is a repository for 3D structural data of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. It provides information on atomic coordinates, experimental details. The PDB is managed by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/): The Materials Project is a collaborative effort to provide an open-source database of materials properties. The database was established in 2011 and originally focused on battery research. It offers a variety of data, including crystal structures and electronic properties for various materials.\n",

    "[ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/): ChemSpider is a free chemical structure database owned by the Royal Society of Chemistry. It aggregates data from various sources, providing information on chemical structures, properties, and associated biological activities.\n",
