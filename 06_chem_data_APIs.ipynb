    "In this lesson, we will explore online chemical databases and learn how to use Python to retrieve information from them. These databases offer data on chemical structures, properties, biological activities, and more. By the end of this lesson, you will be familiar with several popular chemical data sources and be able to access their data using Python and REST APIs.\n",

    "Some popular chemical databases along with their websites are listed below:\n",
    "\n",
    "[PubChem](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/): PubChem is a comprehensive public database of mostly small molecules. It is maintained by the National Institutes of Health and contains information on compound structures, properties, and in some cases, experimental properties.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ChEMBL](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/chembl/): ChEMBL is a large-scale bioactivity database for drug discovery. It is maintained by the European Molecular Biology Laboratory (EMBL) and contains information on bioactive molecules, targets, and assay data, mainly curated from scientific literature.\n",
    "\n",
    "[Protein Data Bank (PDB)](https://www.rcsb.org/): The Protein Data Bank is a repository for 3D structural data of proteins, nucleic acids, and their complexes. It provides information on atomic coordinates, experimental details. The PDB is managed by the Research Collaboratory for Structural Bioinformatics (RCSB).\n",
    "\n",
    "[Materials Project](https://materialsproject.org/): The Materials Project is a collaborative effort to provide an open-source database of materials properties. The database was established in 2011 and originally focused on battery research. It offers a variety of data, including crystal structures and electronic properties for various materials.\n",
    "\n",
    "[ChemSpider](http://www.chemspider.com/): ChemSpider is a free chemical structure database owned by the Royal Society of Chemistry. It aggregates data from various sources, providing information on chemical structures, properties, and associated biological activities.\n",
    "\n",
    "[NIST Chemistry WebBook](https://webbook.nist.gov/chemistry/): The Chemistry WebBook is maintained by the National Institutes of Standards and Technology (NIST) and provides chemical and physical property data for molecular systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "There are many more examples of chemical data sources which we were not able to list here."

    "All of these databases mentioned so far are accessible on the web through your browser. \n",

    "\n",
    "Many of these databases can be accessed programmatically through something called a REST API.\n",

    "A REST API is a type of web API that is used to allow different software systems to communicate with each other over the internet. \n",

    "Usually a REST API is accessed by varying parameters in a URL.\n",
    "\n",
    "We will work with the PubChem REST API first to demonstrate what this means.\n",
    "\n",
    "PubChem has a few REST APIs and the first we will look at is called [PUG REST](https://pubchem.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/docs/pug-rest#section=URL-based-API).\n",
    "\n",
    "<div class=\"warning admonition\">\n",
    "<p class=\"admonition-title\">Warning</p>\n",
    "    <p>Please note that PUG REST is not designed for very large volumes (millions) of requests. PubChem asks that any script or application not make more than 5 requests per second, in order to avoid overloading the PubChem servers.</p>\n",
    "    <p>If you need to build a very large dataset, it is recommended that you contact PubChem</p>\n",
