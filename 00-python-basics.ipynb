    "There are many different programming languages, each with their own strengths, weaknesses, and uses. \n",
    "Some popular programming languages you might hear about are Javascript (used on the web - any website with interactive content likely uses javascript), Python (scientific programming and many other applications), C++ (high performance applications - much of computational chemistry, self-driving cars, etc), SQL (databases), and many more.\n",

    "Python is a computer programming language that has become ubiquitous in scientific programming. \n",
    "The Python programming language was first introduced in the year 1991, and has grown to be one of the most popular programming languages for both scientists and non-scientists. \n",
    "According to the [2022 Stack Overflow Developer Survey](https://survey.stackoverflow.co/2022/#most-popular-technologies-language-prof), Python is the fourth most popular programming language.\n",
    "Compared to other programming languages, Python is considered more intutitive to start learning and is also extremely versatile. \n",
    "Python can be used to build web applications, interact with databases, and calculate and analyze data.\n",
