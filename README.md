[![Binder](https://mybinder.org/badge_logo.svg)](https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/molssi-education/acs-2023-notebooks/HEAD?labpath=table_of_contents.ipynb)

This repository contains notebooks presented at the Spring 2023 ACS Meeting for a workshop called "Python for Data Science in Chemistry".

Topics for these notebooks include:
* Python basics
* Introduction to RDKit
* Introduction to Pandas / Seaborn
* Introduction to Fitting and Train/Test Split using SciKitLearn
* Introduction to Chemistry Web APIs, in particular PubChem


## Running the notebooks

There are many options to run these notebooks. We recommend using JupyterLab instead of Jupyter notebook.

### Lauch on Binder
Click the binder badge or [this link]((https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/molssi-education/acs-2023-notebooks/HEAD?labpath=table_of_contents.ipynb) to launch a notebook in a binder. Creating the environment will take a few minutes, and your work is not saved between sessions.

### Run on GitHub CodeSpaces
This repository is set up to run in a GitHub CodeSpace. Click the green "Code" button on this repository and choose "CodeSpaces". This will open a VSCode environment in GitHub CodeSpaces. Usage will be billed to your personal account, however, GitHub gives some free codespace hours to all accounts each month.

### Run on ChemCompute
These notebooks are all compatible with [chemcpompute.org](https://chemcompute.org/)

### Install locally
An environment.yml file is included that you can use to create a conda environment for the notebooks if you have the conda package manager installed.
