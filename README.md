# Python Workshop at ACS 2023
This repository contains notebooks presented at the Fall and Spring 2023 ACS Meetings for a workshop called "Python for Data Science in Chemistry".

Topics for these notebooks include:
* Python basics
* Introduction to RDKit
* Introduction to Pandas / Seaborn
* Introduction to Fitting and Train/Test/Split using SciKitLearn
* Introduction to Chemistry Web APIs (PubChem)


## Running the notebooks

There are many options to run these notebooks. We recommend using JupyterLab instead of Jupyter notebook.

### Run on GitHub CodeSpaces
This repository is set up to run in a GitHub CodeSpace. Click the green "Code" button on this repository and choose "CodeSpaces". This will open a VSCode environment in GitHub CodeSpaces. Usage will be billed to your personal account, however, GitHub gives some free codespace hours to all accounts each month.

### Run on ChemCompute
These notebooks are all compatible with [chemcpompute.org](https://chemcompute.org/).

### Install locally
An environment.yml file is included that you can use to create a conda environment for the notebooks if you have the conda package manager installed.
