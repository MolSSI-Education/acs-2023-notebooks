    "Mol object instances can be created by a variety of methods.  We've seen some examples of Mol objects being created from SMILES strings, now we'll learn some additional ways a Mol can be created.\n",
    "\n",
    "Data for any system under investigation that is non-ideal, from real systems in experimental methods to optimized geometries in QM methods, cannot be communicated via a smile string.  In these situations, often more detailed specifications are needed, such as an accurate 3D geometry with explicit hydrogens.  Part of the utility of RDKit lies in its ability to create Mol objects using a variety of input formats, so that we can take molecular data from other sources or research processes and generate additional properties and descriptors.\n",
    "\n",
    "Different methods are called for depending on the format of the molecule's specifications, depending on what you're passing passing around, between researchers, applications, or modules.  Two common and versatile formats that we'll cover today are the MOL file and related Structural Data File (SDF)."
